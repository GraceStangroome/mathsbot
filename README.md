# Welcome to Math Bot. 
Math bot does some specific calculations in python, so that you can do other things :)

Math bot will ask you what you wish to calculate, and can remember previously given arrays and data points to work with again.
Its memory is reset every time you finish working with Math bot.

Although capitalisation doesn't matter when requesting a specific calculation, spelling and any extra spaces will confuse math bot. Below are a list of calculations Math bot can do, and what you need to type to trigger that calculation.

To finish, type "end".
## What Math Bot can do:
### Accuracy
    - For this, type "accuracy". 
Math bot will ask for the nmber of correctly classified data points, and then the total number of data points, and return the accuracy.
### Precision
    - For this, type "precision". 
Math bot will ask for the number of true and false positives, and return the precision.
### Recall
    - For this, type "recall". 
Math bot will ask for the number of true and false negatives, and return the precision.
### MSE (Mean Squared Error)
    - For this, type "mse". 
Math bot will calculate the MSE after asking for a list of x's and corresponding y's
### MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
    - For this, type "mae". 
Math bot will calculate the MAE after asking for a list of x's and corresponding y's
### F1
    - For this, type "f1". 
Math bot will calculate the f1 given the umber of true positives, false negatives and false positives.
Math bot does not remember any previously given false/true positives/negatives.
### KNN Weights (K Nearest Neighbour Weights)
    - For this, type "knn weights".
Using x's and corresponding y's, Math Bot calculates the euclidean distance to calculate the K Nearest Neighbour weights.
### SD (Standard Deviation)
    - For this, type "sd".
Math bot will ask for a list of values and will calculate the SD.
### Mean
    - For this, type "mean".
Math bot will ask for a list of values and will calculate the mean.
### Euclidean Distance
    - For this, type "euclidean distance" or "euclidean.
Math bot will ask for a list of xs and ys and will calculate the euclidean distance.
### Manhattan Distance
    - For this, type "manhattan distance" or "manhattan.
Math bot will ask for a list of xs and ys and will calculate the manhattan distance.
### Gaussian Probability (Normal Distribution)
Math bot will find the probability density at a particular point given a list of numbers
### Gaussian Mixture Model
Math bot estimates parameters of a Gaussian mixture model probability distribution
## Upcoming is:
More details always coming soon!
### Bayes Theorem
### KNN
### Linear Regression
This gives you the gradient, y-intercept, SSE (Sum Squared Error) and R Squared
### Naive Bayes Classifier 
Calculates which class a new data point will be in
